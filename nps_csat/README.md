# NPS is dumb

## Calculating NPS
1. Collect NPS survey results, where customers rate their likelihood of recommending your product or service on a scale of 0 to 10. 
2. Subtract the percentage of detractors (scores 0 to 6) from the percentage of promoters (scores 9 to 10). The passives (scores 7 to 8) don't factor in. 

Example 1: 
- Ten people respond, each one responding with a score from 1 to 10 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. 
- Promotors = 20% 
- Detractors = 60%. 
- NPS = 20% - 60% = -40. 

Example 2: 

## Why scrutinizing over NPS scores is frustrating. 
1. The NPS score, in it's simplicity, implies a level of precision that isn't necessarily true. Scores are typically stated as "our NPS score is 20" without any type of confidence interval band or margin of error. We can ask how many responses were collected that factored into that NPS score, but what we're really trying to understand is the level of precision and uncertainty in that score. 
2. The NPS score can go down (from 20 to 18) and it's not immediately clear whether that is due to a lower proportion of promotor responses than before, a higher proportion of detractor responses than before, or both.
