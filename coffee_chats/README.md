# Coffee Chats
So during the pandemic, my colleagues on my broader team at work were looking for ways to connect with each other. People opted into the coffee chat program, and I would randomly pair people up each week. So it became a task to do the matching but make sure that people weren't matched with the same person twice, unless they had already matched with everyone else. I knew there was a way to write a script to help out with this, but because there were enough people that were out week to week because of vacations, I just kept doing it manually. 

Now I want to figure out how to do this in Python.
